1 107 Behold! The king's chamber!
2 100 Wow, never thought I'd be here.
3 101 So shiny.
;
7 107 Finally get to see my brother again.
10 100 Getting emotional?
12 107 Yes, I want to beat him up very much.
;
10 101 What will become of me after we release you?
15 107 You'll be rejoined with me again.
;
5 100 From our history books Othim seems invincible.
7 107 Oh, really?
9 107 That's too much exaggeration if you ask me.
11 107 Maybe he needed you people to believe that so no one will discover he's really weak.
;
3 107 I wonder if he's kept any aces up his sleeve...
5 100 What was that?
6 107 Nothing.
;
8 100 Where did I even come from?
10 100 Will you ever tell me?
15 107 You're just an abandoned orphan I picked up off the streets.
18 107 Why you, though, is a problem I don't even know the answer to.
20 107 Sometime it seems that darkness has a hive mind of its own.
;
5 100 And what is my name?
8 107 I don't know, child.
9 107 And I don't think I ever will know.
10 107 But given all that you've done to reinstate me as king...
11 107 I'm sure giving you a honorary name won't be too hard.
;
3 107 He's near.
4 100 Othim?
5 101 Grr...
10 107 Be brave.
11 107 Go on.
;
18 100 Why is it so quiet here?
20 107 Hm. I guess he's expecting us.
22 107 Cleared out the palace in case we decide to destroy everything in our path.
25 107 How typical of him, to see me as a barbaric animal.
;
9 100 All that's left is to defeat Othim to get him and the others to undo their binding spell, right?
11 107 Yes.
15 100 And this is for the greater good?
17 107 Of course.
18 107 You will see very very soon.
;
23 123 Zarkolth!
24 107 Hello, Othim.
;
1 123 Zarkolth, I know you're hiding in this poor soul's body.
2 123 Come out and face me like a king!
3 123 It's impossible for you to get through me.
4 123 My light shines brighter than any of your minions, brother!
5 107 Ignore him.
6 107 Wear him down until he's too tired to attack.
17 123 Perhaps you have too much room to run.
35 123 Stop running away you coward!
36 123 You're not fit to be king!
44 107 He's tired, now's the chance!
