1 101 I sense power.
2 107 That would be me.
4 107 We are getting closer.
;
5 100 It seems that they developed more than cannons to fend you off.
7 107 Are these pseudo-darkness bothering you?
8 107 They aren't pure, so the'll simply wither away.
9 107 It's only a matter of time.
;
10 100 How many of the true seven are left?
12 107 My brother, his wife and the Wallace, sworn protector of the royal family.
14 107 Some sources said he's passed away.
15 107 And from Harriot's mumble I would assume that to be true.
18 107 So that leaves the self-presumed king and queen.
;
6 100 This' a nice palace.
7 101 Yes!
10 107 Yeah? We're going to rule this place together.
;
4 107 From now on you have to be more cautious.
6 107 You're in the royal palace, where the light shine the strongest.
10 100 I thought I was invulnerable to light.
12 107 You might be special, but why take the chance?
15 107 Besides, as much as I hate to admit it, my brother's light is several times stronger than normal.
;
3 100 If I free you, aren't the true seven just going to put you back?
5 107 Nay.
6 107 For the past twenty years I've prepared myself in the mindscape.
7 107 Twenty years is hardly enough time for them to even imagine what I'm capable of now.
;
4 100 Should I be helping King Othim instead?
5 101 Traitor!
7 107 It's ok, shadow, let the boy's mind wonder.
8 107 He'll eventually see the true seven as nothing but corrupted.
;
15 107 Would you like to hear my story?
18 100 Sure.
;
5 107 Othim and I had a uneventful childhood.
6 107 We were close, but became distant once father passed away and I took to the throne.
8 107 He wanted the throne too, I could see it in his eyes.
10 107 But it would go over too well with the kingdom if their new king was a murderer.
;
2 107 When I had free time, I studied dark magic.
3 107 It's really not as evil as it sounds.
4 107 And I was preparing against it not for it.
5 107 I had a hunch my brother would take this as an excuse to cast me away.
8 107 What a shame my royal subject believe his lies. 
;
2 107 But before the night they snuck in on me during my prayers...
4 107 I had managed to learn the skill of hiding away inside the mind.
7 107 Time pass the same there, yet I no longer had materialistic needs.
10 107 I built on what I remembered during the twenty years in isolation.
13 107 And a couple years ago I finally broke free.
14 107 Meaning I can telepathically manipulate others.
15 107 So here we are.
16 101 Beautiful story.
20 100 No wonder this was never taught in history class.
21 100 Othim would be dethroned if anyone knew.
24 107 Time to take back what's mine.
25 107 Let's go meet the queen.
;
1 122 I may not be as strong as my husband or my son.
2 122 But what I lack in power I make up for with patience.
3 122 And I can exploit the flaw in your design, Zarkolth.
4 122 Your vessel can't move on without contaminating every grid of space.
5 122 So since I'm bright enough you can't touch me...
6 122 If I just don't move from my position...
7 122 I can hold you here indefinitely!
