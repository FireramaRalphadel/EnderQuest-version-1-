1 107 Wake up, my child.
2 107 Go forth and spread darkness to this world.
;
7 100 Where am I?
14 100 Who am I?
;
1 100 Why is the world so dark?
;
25 100 Am I doing the right thing?
;
12 100 My parents, are they looking for me?
;
1 107 I am your creator.
2 107 Finish your mission and you shall be free.
;
7 100 That voice...
15 100 ...is it...
23 101 ...me?
;
10 100 Where am I going?
;
18 100 Am I in control of myself?
;
1 107 Child, let me put your porblems to rest.
;
;
1 104 Halt! Young one, I sense great darkness residing in you.
2 104 Have no fear, son of Othim, for I, Greenwald the Light Dragon, shall release you from your suffering!
27 104 I can still sense some light in you.
28 104 ...perhaps it takes one to defeat one...
29 104 I should notify the others, for we shall meet again, son of Zarkloth!
