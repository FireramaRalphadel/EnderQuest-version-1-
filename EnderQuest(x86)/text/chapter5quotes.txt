1 107 Seems like Othim wasn't so pure himself afterall.
3 100 What do you mean?
7 107 I always though a part of why he sealed me up was cause I was gaining too much knowledge about darkness.
10 107 And yet it seems he has built darkness cannons.
;
20 100 Why would king Othim create something from darkness if he was against it?
22 107 To counter me, of course.
24 107 The brighter the light, the darker the shadow.
;
4 107 At the end the only way he could think of to stop me was to become me.
6 107 How poetic.
;
10 100 Greenwald mentioned they have plans to stop you.
12 101 Stop US!
15 107 Yes, stop us.
20 107 I wouldn't be alarmed.
24 107 Nothing they do now really matters anymore.
;
3 100 I'm tasked to defeat the true seven, then what?
6 107 It seems you're misinformed.
7 107 You're to release me from the mindscape they bound me to.
9 107 Defeating them is merely a statement of your power.
;
7 100 What if they decide not to release you?
8 100 I don't think I know how to do it myself.
;
3 107 I have gathered information from many other possessed vessels such as you.
5 107 They plan to release me if you prove to be strong enough.
10 100 But that doesn't make any sense.
11 100 They could simply leave up locked up.
12 107 That's where you're wrong, child.
15 107 If I'm truly harmless locked up, who's controlling you?
;
2 100 You mean I'm not in control?
3 101 I'm in control!
5 107 You never were.
8 107 You can try, but I'll never let you leave an area without spreading your gift first.
;
9 100 How come I can still talk to you then?
10 100 Doesn't me talking to you means I'm somehow still in control?
;
6 107 Child, you are only talking because you are too young.
9 107 Too pure a mind for my darkness to completely grasp.
12 107 And yet it is you that they find indestructible.
15 107 A mix of light and dark, and none can destroy.
18 107 Be thankful, you are on my side.
20 107 You shall be well compensated afterwards.
;
1 100 This training ground is really large.
2 107 I used to practice swordfighting here with Othim.
3 107 Naturally I beat him every time.
5 100 How'd you get sealed up then?
7 107 Seven against one can hardly be called even odds.
;
1 120 Stop! You are trespassing on the grounds of King Othim!
2 120 Surrender now, or I, prince Harriot, shall end you right here and now!
3 107 Prince Harriot, that's Othim's child.
4 120 I won't let you get close to me!
5 120 Suffer the wrath of my modified darkness cannons!
20 120 I finally understand why father needed to prepare for your return, uncle.
22 120 I'm sorry I've sullied the name of the fifth true knight, Wallace.
23 120 I could never replace you.
