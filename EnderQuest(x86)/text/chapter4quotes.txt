1 107 Would you look at that, walls made of light.
2 107 Looks like they tried to prepare after all.
5 107 And they even used back-up generators!
7 107 Sad that they couldn't bother to cover up the generator with another light of wall.
10 107 Simply step on both generator to disable the wall.
11 107 Then we should be able to pass by, no problem.
;
4 100 May I ask your name now?
5 101 No, master shouldn't have to talk to you...
8 107 Quiet servant, I make my own choices.
9 101 Yes, master.
10 107 My name is Zarkolth, former king of Centry.
11 100 I thought you died on a horseride accident?
12 107 Lies! How could I have died such a humiliating death.
13 101 Yes! How could he!
14 107 Shut up.
15 101 Yes.
;
8 107 I feel comforted in your ability to resist against the light.
10 107 Not every one of my vessels, or any other, for the matter, could stand up to it like you do.
12 107 Perhaps, it's that spark of determi...
13 107 No, I don't think that's the right phrase for the situation we're in.
;
3 100 So, former king Zar...
4 101 King Zarkolth! He's not dead!
5 100 Sorry, king Zarkolth, does your brother know you escaped death?
7 107 Ha! That arrogant traitor!
8 107 He was the one who did me in!
10 100 I'm sorry, I don't understand.
15 107 When you have the power to rule a country, many will try to take it away from you.
17 107 Your brother killed you for the throne?
20 107 He was always skeptical of what I was doing, but I never thought he would act on it.
;
18 101 Tired...
20 100 Maybe we should rest.
;
4 101 Dragon!
5 100 Where?
6 107 Look up.
10 100 Should I run?
11 107 It's up to you.
;
8 101 I think it spotted you.
10 100 Deep breath, I'll be fine.
17 107 Here cometh, finish him.
;
1 104 Hello again, young messenger of darkness.
2 101 Die!
3 100 Shush!
4 101 No!
7 104 Quite peculiar, it seems that you are having an internal conflict.
9 107 Don't let his talking get to you, my child.
10 107 You will do great things for me.
11 107 I trust in your judgement to get out of this alive.
14 104 More than that, I sense Zarkolth, practitioner of the dark.
19 104 How could you, such a fine young boy, be plagued by the likes of him?
22 100 I...
23 101 Hiss! No contact with the light!
;
10 104 If you wish to avoid pain, turn back now.
15 104 Grimel and I will be waiting up ahead.
20 104 Swift death awaits.
;
5 107 Well done, not a scratch on you.
7 100 Thanks.
9 101 Thanks to me.
11 100 Who was this Grimel guy Greenwald spoke of?
14 107 The electrician.
15 107 He runs most of the projects in this lab.
20 107 Smart beyond his years, it's a shame he decided to side with my brother.
;
2 107 There they are.
3 101 There they are.
4 100 There they are.
30 107 Go do me proud, my child.
31 107 See you on the other side.
;
1 104 So you have chosen death.
2 118 Then I shall help you fulfill your wish.
3 118 Observe my newest invention: Light Armor!
25 118 Greenwald, it seems like I'm running out of power.
26 104 Young one, you do not understand what you are doing.
27 104 Zarkolth is the messenger of darkness and should not be released.
28 104 But should you be so hellbent on doing so...
29 104 We have other plans in place.
