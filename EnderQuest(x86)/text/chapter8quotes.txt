1 123 Very well, you have bested me.
2 107 Now release me.
3 123 As you wish.
4 123 True Seven! Assemble!
9 124 At last, I'm free!
10 123 Zarkolth! You will not step any farther!
11 124 You don't understand what I'm capable of!
12 124 Vessel! Come join me by my side!
;
1 124 Yes!
2 124 Now with my most loyal servant with me...
3 124 This world will PAY for what it has done to ME!!!
4 124 HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
;
1 124 Tsk. To think I had started to trust you.
2 123 Give up, Zarkolth.
3 123 We released you to defeat you once and for all.
4 124 Then bring it on!
5 124 No light can pierce my darkness!
6 123 That's why we're counting on your own vessel to bring you down.
7 124 I don't think so!
8 123 Your wife was right when she said my manipulation tactic had a flaw.
;
0 124 He can't move on unless every grid is filled with darkness!
1 124 So I'll just make this impossible.
2 124 Without cannons!
;
;
0 104 It's okay, little one, I'm here to help.
1 118 Greenwald, NO!
2 104 Win this fight for all of us, alright?
;
;
0 124 Did you think it was going to be that easy?
1 124 Let me teach you a lesson.
2 124 Never depend on the help of others!
3 108 Don't listen to him!
4 108 Let us do what we can to help you!
5 124 If you're helping him, then I just have to make this more impossible!
;
;
0 124 Stop messing up my plans!
1 124 You can't spread your darkness if you can't get there!
2 111 I can help you with that.
3 113 *SNAP*
4 124 NO!!!
;
;
0 124 What about this?
1 118 Stay in the top-left corner and I'll deal with this.
3 118 Zarkolth! My dragon friend sacrificed himself to destroy you, so I will finish his dying wish!
4 123 Quick! While Zarkolth's busy with us, spread your darkness!
;
;
0 124 Fine!
1 124 If these object can't stop you, then I'll just make YOU immobile!
2 121 I found a weak spot!
;
0 124 You fool!
1 124 That shot did nothing!
2 124 And now you'll all PAY for your insolence!
;
0 123 Zarkolth! Let the boy go and come fight us!
1 124 Oh, I will.
2 124 Once I take care of this threat HERE!
4 124 Child! Come stand with me!
5 124 What?
6 122 Your darkness might be strong, but I can take a few hits.
7 123 Mogolyda, don't be a hero!
8 122 Use my powers to prepare for what's to come.
9 122 I believe in you.
;
;
0 122 This is it.
1 122 Your next step has to be without me...
2 120 Mother!
3 122 Do me proud, son.
;
0 124 You'll never beat me!
1 124 I AM the superior darkness!
7 124 DIE!
8 124 DIEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!
;
0 124 HAHAHA!
1 124 Did you think your darkness could coompete against mine?
2 124 You can't beat me even if you managed to bend all light to your will.
3 124 Surrender now and I'll give you a swift death.
4 123 Child, don't listen to him.
5 123 He's weakened, you just need to absord more light.
6 124 NOOOOO!!!
;
5 108 Finish him!
10 111 Finish him.
15 118 For Greenwald!
20 120 For the Queen!
25 123 For Centry!
;
0 126 Where... Where am I?
1 123 Zarkolth! By the power given to me by the people of Centry, I'm executing you for the use of dark magic against our people!
2 120 Father, wait!
3 123 What is it?
4 120 He's different.
5 108 Your majesty, I think we drove the darkness away.
6 123 Did we, now?
7 123 Well, where's the child who helped us?
8 111 I believe he perished along with the darkness.
9 118 Sad such a pure soul had to be plagued by the likes of him.
10 123 Get up, brother, this kingdom needs our guidance.
11 123 And after all the damage you've caused, we've got a lot to rebuild.
16 118 So we're just going to pretend...
17 120 It's for the best.
22 118 Greenwald...
