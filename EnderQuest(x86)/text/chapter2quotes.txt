11 100 Uh... the light... its so strong.
12 100 Had I... fallen asleep?
;
5 100 I can't seem to remember anything.
;
1 100 Whao! This light... I can't even open my eyes!
8 107 Hiss... Stay away from the light you fool!
9 100 You can't make me.
22 107 You can't keep relying on the light.
29 107 Darkness is the true nature of this world!
;
23 100 It seems that the spirit's grasp is weaker around strong light.
;
1 107 No! Destroy this place! I command you!
2 100 I don't want to agree with you.
3 100 But the light is too bright.
4 101 I'll finish it fast.
;
15 100 What is happening?
;
1 107 I can sense a strong light presence nearby.
10 107 Stay on guard, my child.
20 107 Defeat the menace and we'll be another step closer to reunion!
;
7 100 Excuse me, but who is the voice speaking in my head?
10 107 Hush, for now. Hopefully someday you'll see what we're both working for.
;
3 100 What is it you aren't telling me?
5 100 Is what I'm doing so wrong that you must do it through me?
7 101 But you enjoy it, don't you?
9 101 Now you have a sense of belonging, that's something you didn't have before.
;
19 100 Perhaps... perhaps I can just stop and go home.
21 101 Perhaps. If you even remember where home is.
22 107 You are home now, my child.
23 107 And soon,  we will meet.
;
9 107 The presence... It is here.
10 107 Be on guard.
11 107 It will surely be a great shame to lose such a pure vessel.
;
1 108 You must be the dark child Greenwald spoke of.
2 108 You will not go any farther.
3 109 For I am Augustus the Centrian Guard.
4 110 Let your sins wash away in my holy blessings!
22 108 How is he not dead?
27 108 Is my light really not stronger than the darkness?
36 108 Perhaps this really is for the best.
